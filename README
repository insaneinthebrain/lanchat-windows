NOTE: THERE ARE SOME VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES YOU MUST MAKE IN THE LANCHAT.PRO FILE
THEY ARE COMMENTED IN THE FILE ITSELF, BUT IT WILL NOT COMPILE WITHOUT THOSE CHANGES.

This is the windows version of my Lanchat linux program
both can communicate with one another as long as the ports are the same.

This program is a "learning c++" project for me.
I am more than happy to share the source with anyone who may find it usefull for their own projects.

This program utilizes winsock32 to send messages over a LAN.
It uses multithreading to overcome waiting on the recv function before being able to send a message.

This program was created with Qt Creator.
